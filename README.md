# Labyrinth Game
This is a simple game about creating your own labyrinths. The game has no storyline or levels. But it supports VR. So letâ€™s dive into it for better experiences. The game is browser based, so you don't need to intall any apps. Just run it in your web browser and you're fine.

I tested it with Gear VR (Samsung) so I can tell that Samsung Internet VR and Oculus Internet VR works perfect. It's much fun to play your own labyrinth in the VR world. **You don't need any special controllers!**

The main thought is to train your memory while you always have that little taste of competition.

# Future plans:
- Server side database (at the moment it is saved in local storage)
- 3D models for controllers and teleport option
- Wall and ground textures
- Random generated labyrinth
- AR for local cooperation with friends
- Wall tags to mark your orientation (you can lose yourself)
- Easter eggs! For hungry gamers :-)
