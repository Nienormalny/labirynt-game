# Labyrinth Game
Simple game about creating your own Labyrinths.
This game has no storyline and levels. But its supports VR! So lets get dive into it for better expiriences!
Game is browserbase game, so you don't need to intall any apps, just run in you browser and that it!

I tested it with Gear VR (Samsung) so i can tell that Samsung Internet Vr and Oculus Internet Vr works great!
And make much fun to play own labyrithn in VR world! **You don't need special controllers!**

Main think is to train your memory with little taste of competition.
